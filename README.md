a demo show how i use google map and Place


Write an app that will help tourists and sights to see wherever they may be:

1. Use an appropriate API (e.g., Google Places, Yelp, Foursquare, Flickr, etc) to grab

information about 20 interesting locations around the device’s current location.

2. Plot each location on a map view.

3. Display the information about each location.

4. Let the user pick a starting location of their choice on the map. From the selected

location:

a. Draw a straight line on the map that connects the current location to the

closest location marker on the map.

b. When all the points are linked, it should link back to the initially selected

location to close the loop.

c. Make the path visit each location once, and be as short as possible.

d. The route must be an aerial-view path (i.e. straight lines), not a

street-navigation path. (The paths are as the crow ies, don’t worry about

routing on roads or other paths).
